2) the statement of people not being satisfied of wins , meaning we play to win. This is our job"
2018/10/27 04:55:31,Use the same energy you doubt yourself with to believe in yourself. You overthink things that will never happen but don’t feed the possibilities of what can go right. It’s all imagined. You might as well be busy visualizing something greater into existence for yourself
