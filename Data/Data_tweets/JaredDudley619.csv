2019/03/04 06:09:02,One problem with young tanking teams is that individual player statistics are skewed. A player doing well on a bad team may not be a good player. Seen it happen with Nets.
2019/03/11 01:53:01,@JaredDudley619 @PrioritySports Yes but he can help Miami they need him. Why let him go??
2019/02/13 02:54:58,"To make a LOOONG story extremely short, Antonio Brown will be playing WR for the Steelers in 2019 or he will be sitting out. He has NO leverage and the team takes a massive hit from trading him.
This is NOT the NBA buddy."
2019/03/10 13:39:23,The Antonio Brown saga is finally nearing a close. Sources say the #Steelers are dealing AB to the #Raiders in exchange for a third round pick and a fifth round pick in this 2019 draft. Brown will also get a reworked contract that makes him the NFL’s highest paid WR.
2019/03/11 01:14:21,Can someone please explain to me why the @MiamiHEAT are paying @WayneElli22 to help the @DetroitPistons win and climb the standings while they are barely holding on to 8????
2019/03/10 20:12:24,@JaredDudley619 @AB84 Lol be better Jared. If one of your teammates didn’t show up on game 82 that was a must win to get in the playoffs you’d be saluting that man. Please

2019/03/11 02:12:18,There’s a HUGE part of me that wishes to see @JaredDudley619 stay after his contract expires and work with the coaching staff in Brooklyn. His presence has been monumental this year.
2019/03/10 22:07:20,@JaredDudley619 This just shows how badly they wanted to get rid of AB. They are taking a $20+ million cap hit to get rid of him. Unprecedented.
2019/03/11 03:29:14,@JaredDudley619 @NetsDaily The vet minimum salary is probably more than 90% of assistant coaching jobs.

2019/03/10 21:36:43,@Frechinawesome2 @JaredDudley619 Read how AB wa$ treated by the Steelers. ESPN has a good article on this. There's fault on both sides. NFL players are poorly treated and the Steelers did not treat him fairly.
2019/03/10 22:24:28,@JaredDudley619 @AB84 you support what this guy did?
2019/03/10 20:48:12,"@JaredDudley619 @AB84 If this was only about player vs owner, sure he won. To get there he quit on his team with the playoffs on the line, and now has handicapped them with dead cap space. The clear losers: Steeler fans like me."
