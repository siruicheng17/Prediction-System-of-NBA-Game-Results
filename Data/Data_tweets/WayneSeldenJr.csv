After regaining possession, a player is allowed to regain his pivot foot and pass or shoot prior to that foot returning to the ground. This is legal."

The last @chicagobulls players to both score 35+ in the same game were Michael Jordan (37) and Scottie Pippen (37) in 1996. https://t.co/kE35KDjy85"
