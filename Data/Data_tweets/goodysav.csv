2018/12/20 15:58:36,Hoopin overseas is about more than basketball. You gotta really love hoop to do this. You gotta work hard everyday and put in the extra work. You gotta be ok with being TIRED and LONELY. Embrace your situation and thrive in it. Most importantly you must find what makes you happy!
